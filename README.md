## Introduction
In the early stages of your project, you will primarily be using your team's private GitHub repository for knowledge sharing and project management. However, git is fundamentally for software revision control. As your project progresses into the build phase, you should use git and GitHub for this purpose.

git and GitHub are industry standards in software development. It's important to develop proficiency with git as it is a critical tool in the software development community. This assignment aims to help you overcome the learning curve with git.
