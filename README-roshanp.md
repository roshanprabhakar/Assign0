## Some personal projects...

### post-pintos
- An exploration of bare metal programming in ARM, following cs 140.
- An exploration of different virtualization software, as well as a deep dive into armv8 scheme and cortex processors.
- Implements the pintos post-boot environment for the raspberry pi 3b, pre multiprocessing.  <br>

## A few interesting research projects...

### Novel video encoding:
- Mentored a group of highschool students in developing a novel video compression scheme.
- We developed a key-point based encoder that demonstrated a proof of concept of the idea, achieving ultra-low bitrate consumption.
- Work done with Stanford ISL. <br>

### Error correrction:
- Developed a repository for the exploration of protograph LDPC based error correction codes.
- Implements multiple construction algorithms for these codes, and extends a previous library for regular LDPC codes. <br>
